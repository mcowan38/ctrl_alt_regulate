## Abstract
- This study explores young adults’ perspectives on artificial intelligence (AI) governance, focusing on their often-overlooked role in regulatory discourse. Building on initial findings from a pilot study, we administer an online Qualtrics survey to 300 participants from Canadian universities to assess their sentiments toward AI, its perceived impact on various aspects of daily life, and their views on existing regulatory frameworks. From these preliminary insights, we expect the final results to reveal a cautious optimism about AI’s potential benefits, balanced by concerns regarding equitable access, job displacement, and the necessity for institutional oversight. We further anticipate that respondents will favor rules-based regulatory approaches, underscoring the need for inclusive frameworks that address both risks and societal well-being. By incorporating the perspectives of younger generations, this study provides critical guidance for policymakers seeking to shape responsive and effective AI governance strategies.
